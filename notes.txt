For the second script, a super easy way, in that testing phase, would be to reuse the main script, changing 
       maxRequests: 1,  
so it writes only to the first result, main profile
and deleting {name}, so the only problem now is how to pass our script to the new page, I tried with this Jquery but does not work,

we should target to open class="artdeco-dropdown"
the logic look has to be different
